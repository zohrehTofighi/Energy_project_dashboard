# ðŸ”‹ Energy Analysis Dashboard

This is a dashboard I made with **Streamlit** to show how energy is produced in different countries over time.

## What it does

- Choose a country from the sidebar
- See charts for:
  - Population
  - Hydro energy
  - Nuclear energy
  - Renewable energy
  - Solar energy
- The charts are interactive (you can hover, zoom, etc.)

## The liberary used

- `pandas` and `numpy` for the data
- `streamlit` for the app
- `plotly` and `altair` for the charts
- `Pillow` to show images

## The dataset 

I used a CSV file called `Panel format.csv`.  
It has info like year, country, population, and different types of energy.
